### Client-Side
* jQuery
* Stylus
* Pattern from [The Amazing Pattern Library](http://thepatternlibrary.com/#bunting-flag)

### Server-Side
* Node
* Express
* Jade

### External Libraries
* [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com): My new favorite UI component library with awesome form validation. I like it better than Bootstrap or Foundation.
* [pickadate.js](http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/index.htm): What a cool jQuery library for date and time picker. Easy to use and nicely designed.
* [Odometer](http://github.hubspot.com/odometer/docs/welcome): I used this JavaScript and CSS library to smoothly transition the countdown numbers with ease. Thanks HubSpot!
* [CodesArc Programming Tutorials](http://codesarc.blogspot.com/2014/02/javascript-countdown-for-remaining-time.html): I referenced this _Javascript Countdown For Remaining Time_ tutorial for the countdown feature. I added some logic to prevent the timer from counting down pass 0 and a modal to congratulate the user when the time is up.

### Future Features
* Ability to sign up to receive a daily email reminder
